ComicOrganizer
==============

This application is intended to keep track of your position in webcomics. It currently requires you to type 
or copy/paste the address, and even that functionality is somewhat broken at the moment.

There are 2 different implementations currently online: 
  - The one that currently has some functionality, but is a dead end http://my-comic-updater.appspot.com
  - The one that is currently broken, but has the capacity to be fixed (also the one that reflects the code posted here) http://continuous-comics.appspot.com
